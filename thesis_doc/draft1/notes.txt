Frank's review:
Methods of processing (filtering, PSD, 
	Specific parameters based on defaults, playing around, passed down rules-of-thumb.
Where does the whole human comfort thing fit in
CMIF has been thoroughly documented in literature, just summarize?
Filtering is loose.  Amplification from it is only an estimate. Methods are my own rules-of-thumb. Explain these, list assumptions violated, use FE to demonstrate the feasibility?
 







things that may go in the appendix:
instrumentation plan
modeling methods - specific details on model form and construction
LUSAS modeling
modeling calibration/validation (just summarize with validation in body?)
spectral analysis methods (common (PSD) and uncommon (Devitis))
equations of motion & state space matrices
details on implimenting ss model (scripts and functions)
details on parametric study sampling and implimentation
