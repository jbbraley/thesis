objectives
1 understad the vehicle bridge interaction
	how to approach this I76 problem... what kind of models etc.
larger picture
	HL-93 - range o fimpact factors for different vehicles
	fatigue: cycles per truck
	how to characterize a probelmatic profile (IRI)
	how to model the dynamic amplification etc. with other programs (i.e. simplistic methods)
	
recommendations how to diagnose and mitigte vibration issues

s/5.5 for wheel load or lane

drexel meeting notes

new material to send frank:

simulated bridge response from final simulation (successful profile run)
fft zoomed in
corrected numbers for dist. factors



slides notes from meeting with frank: 11/1/17

expand slides - especially to show work done (magnitude)
begin with some understanding of where we're going (organization of phases) maybe bring it back between phases to remind where we're going
modeling expanded (substructures, modeling decisions etc) try side by side
model updating (parameters, lessons learned, etc.)
	start out with stid circle, then break out 
	how updating was performed (manual?) and final parameters, model changes etc.
	how future updating could be performed if needed, why needed

motivation for why st-id 
bridge wasn't that unique - no direct apparent reasons for the dynamic responses - thus the need for a model
No funny business in initial model - leads to bridge-vehicle modeling

more of the process of how we found out what we know

truck before, on, then off bridge

the truck bridge time history plot - not unique (of the n runs, n were similar)
	boxes around span periods
	point out it's similar to acceleration seen before
	fft of bridge response compared to earlier psd to show same type of vibration
	what's the correlation between velocity and truck acceleration
	show another truck-bridge response for lower speed - tease out that bridge response does not match the trend of truck accel.
	
phase 5
	details about what lusas is doing - more for my research. what shortcuts it's taking
	what do the actual models look like
	talk more about the modeling
	one slide for each of the summary conclusions
	
we've identified the the profile is likely the culprit
must now prove it
