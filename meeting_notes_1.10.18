into is good for lit review (just remove i-76 stuff)

intro should be a compelling argument why people should care
	lack of thorough understanding
	upcoming loading (platooning) could make this a big deal
	"the dynamic vehicle interaction is not well understood" for example. grab attention
	maybe the old ways of calculating worked in the past, but new loading could present a problem
	vision	
	intellectual merit and 
	broader impact
	what am i doing new and why 
	
	leave out I-76 in objectives
	specific to general (inductive)
	learning from specific to generate tools for investigating general 
	1. understand impact factors and mechanisms
	2. impact to design/assessment
	3. impact to loading
	
	work plan - more detail
	a plan on how each task will be accomplished specfically
	what's the back up plan if the tactics dont work
	
	task4 mostly recommendations
	in what situations is 1.33 not okay
	how should testing IM be carried out
