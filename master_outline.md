Vehicle and structural parameters that create unusual structural dynamic response

Parameters include:  
**_Structure_**
1. L/x stiffness/girder stiffness
2. Frequency of global modes
3. Damping ratio
3. Lanes carried
4. Span continuity (2-span vs single)
5. Adjacent structures (e.g. repeat bridges)
6. "Bump" height: 0 10 20 30 mm (Honda, Kobori, 1986)

**_Vehicles_**
1. Vehicle suspension Parameters
  1. Suspension stiffness
  2. Suspension damping
  3. Type/Linearity (e.g. Air, steel)
2. Vehicle weights
3. Truck train
4. Vehicle speed
5. Incident rate (vehicle density on bridge)

### Discussion of mechanisms
1. special cases
  1. repeat bridges driving frequency of vehicles
  2. high adt
  3. vehicle trains
2. vehicle dynamics aligned with structural dynamics

### Discussion of impact (i.e. performance)
1. Durability  
  1. fatigue
  2. deck degradation
2. safety
3. User comfort
4. Suggested change to design code
5. Suggested means of adjusting vehicle parameters (e.g. speeds, suspension systems)

### Case Studies
Truck trains  
I-76
LTBP structures

### Holes in current research
Initial conditions of vehicle and bridge for simulating vbi
Repeated excitation (traffic) or multiple vehicles
Vehicle tuning by preceding structures
Susceptibility comparison of simply supported and continuous to vibration
VBI on bridges with skew
The first fundamental frequencies of LRFD designed bridges as a function of global parameters (i.e. span length, girder spacing) - mostly already done
DOF necessary for looking at bridge response (1 or 2 per wheel, include wheel stiffness)
Quantify added response when including road surface profile, bump, rough road before the bridge, smooth.

### Possible assumptions
Bridge damping = 1%-2%
